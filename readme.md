YelpCamp is a RESTful full-stack application, built with ExpressJS, PassportJS and MongoDB. The app uses EJS templates to interact between the backend and frontend. Users can create an account and post, edit and delete campgrounds. Users can also review campgrounds and leave comments. The mobile repsonisve app is styled with Bootstrap.

My extra features include - 

- Implement Google Maps API to locate campgrounds
- Add CSS3 background animation on landing page
- Display time since post created with Moment JS
- Allow user to sign up as admin
